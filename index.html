        <p>A beautful caribean country, in 1804 Haiti is the first black Republic were slavary abolished.
            For now, this beautiful country has many problems like; social economic, and politic. In accordance with the international community, there are a lot of corruptions made by the majority politic leaders and businessmen.<br>
            All these stuff keep the country poor and miserable. We all hope that Haiti will find the great leader to lead the population in a good way. We pray for you Haiti.
